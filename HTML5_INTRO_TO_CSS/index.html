    <h2>Information About HTML5 and CSS</h2>
    <p>What does peace mean to you? Since everyone's perception of peace is unique, different people will interpret it differently. Having peace is a state of agreement or friendliness, not at strife or war; also, in a state of inner harmony or quiet. Harmony within society and harmony devoid of animosity or violence are referred to as peace. It can be attained by inner peace and psychological serenity, which encompasses calm thoughts and feelings. These attributes—calmness, patience, dignity, empathy, compassion, and self-control—can aid in resolving disputes and fostering a peaceful community.</p>

    <h3>Peace Tips</h3>

    <p> Which symbols stand for peace? Several widely recognized peace symbols are used globally, including the dove, olive branch, V hand signal, and peace flag.  A number of peace symbols have been used in many ways in various cultures and contexts. Numerous civilizations and circumstances have employed peace symbols like the olive branch and dove. Gerald Holtom created the "peace sign" in the 1950s as the emblem for the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), which was later embraced by counterculture and anti-war activists. The nuclear disarmament semaphore signals are superposed by the symbol.</p>

            <h3>Chef Choice</h3>
            <p>When a guest requests a "chef's choice" meal, they typically assume that the chef is aware of the best options and that letting him or her make the selection will produce the best meal possible.Some chefs find that when a guest is willing to place all of their trust in their hands, it inspires confidence and inventiveness. It's a dream come true for me. This is known as m'Ã©tonner (french for "astonish me"). This is fantastic, and I support it in my restaurant. I feel happy there. The phrase "You trust me!" is used when a guest asks me to choose a menu.</p>

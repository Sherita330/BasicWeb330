            <h1>About the Chef</h1>
            <p>Hi there, I'm Dequea Moore. As a chef, I enjoy cooking and using my food to inspire others and spread love. I currently run a catering and personal chef business called Ms. D Spot, where I offer a variety of services like food catering, drinks, meal prep, and d√©cor menu planning with an international flair and southern roots. I enjoy taking people on culinary adventures and surprising them with traditional dishes that are outside of their comfort zones. For me, food is the universe. I dream about food and menus when I wake up. Above all, I feel most at ease in my kitchens, whether they are in my homes or my future restaurant.</p>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>I decide to become a Chef to help people. As a personal chef, I am able to choose the menu for my clients and offer them international and health-conscious options in addition to fresh and local cuisine. Personal chefs frequently operate alone or in small groups in private kitchens. They need to be capable of preparing all kinds of food and creating highly personalized menus for their customers. A personal chef can prepare and ship meals to be reheated upon delivery, or they can cook on location for a client. Being a chef is my comfort zone because it allows me to express love and emotion through food.</p>

        <h3>Qualifications</h3>
        <p>Working in a professional kitchen is a prerequisite for becoming a chef. To learn the fine technical aspects of the trade, many chefs enroll in culinary schools or proceed to community colleges to complete an associate degree program or certificate. Therefore, 2015 saw me enroll in Art Institute International Culinary Arts School, where I graduated with honors in both catering and service. Furthermore, I received my Commission Server Permit for Alcoholic Beverages. I also hold a Safe Serve Certification. 2019 saw my graduation from Nashville State Community College with a degree in business management.</p>

        <h3>Cook or Chef</h3>
        <p>What makes a cook different from a chef? To put it succinctly, a chef is a person who has received training in flavor analysis, culinary arts, recipe creation using fresh ingredients, and high levels of responsibility in the kitchen. A cook is a person who prepares food according to set recipes. A chef, also called a head chef, executive chef, or chef de cuisine, is a qualified cook who manages every area of a kitchen. A chef must possess a wide range of skills, including hiring, firing, and training kitchen staff as well as controlling and managing inventories, purchasing food supplies and cooking equipment, maintaining clean and safe cooking practices, managing kitchen expenses, designing plates, and creating menus. A chef's skill in guiding you on a culinary adventure with credentials from learning with food is what makes them superior to a cook.</p>

            <h1>About the Ocean</h1>
            <p></p>The ocean is a vast body of saltwater that makes up roughly 71% of the surface of the planet. The Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans are the four separate regions that oceanographers and nations around the world have traditionally recognized as belonging to the planet's single ocean.

        <p>Jobs, fishing, food production, marine transportation, trade, fuel, and energy are all supported by the ocean's economic activity. Main production and the cycling of nutrients are supported by the ocean. species that are able to coexist in a specific habitat for an extended period of time without permanently reducing that habitat's productivity.</p>

        <h3>Ocean Recycle</h3>
        <p>Recycling has a significant role in the fight against plastic pollution in the ocean. We must stop the remaining single-use plastic from leaking into the environment after we have taken all reasonable steps to minimize its use. Sand can be distinguished at the microscopic level in plastics even after they have been thoroughly cleaned industrially. Ocean plastic simply cannot be recycled into high-quality products because it loses its qualities after being exposed to sun and salty water for such an extended length of time.</p>

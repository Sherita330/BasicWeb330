            <h1>Welcome to the Ocean</h1>
            <p>How much is the world oceans? How many oceans are in the world? What are the benifits of the ocean? Why is the ocean so much uncharted territories? The world ocean is one and only one. Four oceans have been named historically: the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic. The Southern (Antarctic) Ocean is now recognized as the fifth ocean by the majority of nations, including the United States. The three most well-known are the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian. The oxygen we breathe is produced by the ocean, which also takes in 50 times more carbon dioxide than the atmosphere does. Climate regulation: the ocean, which makes up 70% of Earth's surface, moves heat from the equator to the poles, controlling the planet's temperature and weather patterns. The ocean provides us with oxygen and controls our climate.</p>

            <p>Who lives in the Ocean? Large fish like ocean sunfish, manta rays, and great white sharks also navigate these waters. The blue whale is an ocean mammal that is the largest animal to have ever lived on Earth. It has twice the length of a school bus! Other marine mammals include sea lions, porpoises, and dolphins.</p>

            <h3>Ocean Preservation</h3>
            <p>Why do we need to stop polluting the ocean? We are fed by the ocean; it also gives us jobs and means of subsistence. One instrument for economic growth is the ocean.Our climate is controlled by the ocean, which also supplies our air. We eat from the ocean. It offers means of subsistence and employment. One tool for economic development is the ocean. To live, we require a healthy ocean.</p>

        <h3>Ocean Provides</h3>
        <p>To survive, the ocean must be healthy. Approximately 90% of the heat produced by growing emissions is now absorbed by the ocean. Unprecedented cascade effects, such as ice melting, sea level rise, marine heat waves, and ocean acidification, result from the ocean's warming due to excess heat and energy.</p>

        <h3>Ocean Recycle</h3>
        <p>How do we stop littering? There are numerous effects of ocean pollution on humans and marine life, both directly and indirectly. Ocean excess debris uses oxygen to break down over many years, which reduces the amount of oxygen in the water. Ocean animals like sharks, whales, dolphins, and penguins perish due to low oxygen levels in the water.
            Oxygen depletion is also a result of excess nitrogen and phosphorus in seawater. An area of the ocean may turn into a dead zone where very little marine life can survive when there is significant oxygen depletion there. </p>
